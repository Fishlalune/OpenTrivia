# OpenTrivia
OpenTrivia is currently in very early stages of development. Expect to see a full, complete readme with documentation and everything in early April! 
Until then, this is a very work in progress. 

## What is it? 
Think of it like [Socrative](https://socrative.com/), except less test-like and more flexixble.  OpenTrivia is an all-in-one trivia server that handles a client interface, a host interface, and a slideshow interface (to be projected). It supports the following: 
- (Technically) unlimited teams, rounds, and questions. Your mileage will vary based on the specs of your server 
- Multimedia support with images, audio, and videos 
- Multiple choice, short answer, and third-party answering formats 
- Easy and intuitive question bank editor, also known as Google Sheets (optional)
